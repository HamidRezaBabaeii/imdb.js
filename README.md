a very basic clone of imdb using nodejs , mysql , express and ejs.
i built this project with my dear friend for my university database assignment. it could potentially have bugs/broken features due to lack of time but hope it helps or inspire you.

## how to install

1. download zip folder or clone project with git and install dependencies using `npm install`
2. configure the `config.env` file and save as `.env`
3. run `npm run install` for installation
4. run `npm run start` for starting the server
5. admin panel is located at `/admin` . email is `email@example.com` and password is `password`. change it if you desire.
